## Dataset
Stanford Cars Dataset - 16,185 high-resolution car images across 196 classes.

## Usage
Instructions on how to run the Jupyter Notebook and reproduce the results.

## Future Work
- Increase training epochs to 1000 for better image quality.
- Refine dataset by cropping images to exclude backgrounds and shadows.
- Incorporate enclosed polygons for enhanced CAD compatibility.
- Integrate with CAD software for seamless design iterations.
